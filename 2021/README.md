# AoC 2021

This year I wanted to improve my **Elixir** skills instead of tryout a new lang (last year was Go).

Since **Livebook** was released and I also needed an excuse to play around with it.

Each day is a **Livebook** **Markdown** - **.livemd* - that can be directly imported (or opened, for that matter). The days include example input and I also post them to elixirforum in each Advent of Code day thread.
